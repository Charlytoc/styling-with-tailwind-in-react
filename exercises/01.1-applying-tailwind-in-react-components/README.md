# `01.1` Applying Tailwind in React Components

Welcome to the practical exercise on applying Tailwind CSS classes to style React components! In this lesson, you'll learn how to enhance the appearance of your React components using Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework. This exercise will help you understand how to integrate Tailwind into your React project and apply its classes effectively.

## üìù Instructions:

1. **Setup Tailwind CSS in Your React Project:**
   - If you haven't already, ensure that Tailwind CSS is installed and configured in your React project. You can follow the [official Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for React.

2. **Create a New React Component:**
   - Create a new file named `StyledButton.js` in your `src/components` directory.
   - Define a functional component named `StyledButton` that returns a simple button element.

3. **Apply Tailwind Classes:**
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the button. For example, you can apply classes for background color, text color, padding, and hover effects.
   - Example classes: `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `py-2`, `px-4`, `hover:bg-blue-700`.

4. **Render the Component:**
   - Import and render the `StyledButton` component in your main `App.js` file.
   - Ensure that the button is displayed on the page with the applied styles.

5. **Test Your Styles:**
   - Run your React application and verify that the button appears with the intended styles.
   - Experiment with different Tailwind classes to see how they affect the button's appearance.

## üí° Tips:

- Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of utility classes that you can use to style your components. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for a comprehensive list of available classes.
- Remember to use Tailwind's responsive utilities to make your components adaptable to different screen sizes.

By the end of this exercise, you should have a styled button component in your React application, demonstrating your ability to apply Tailwind CSS classes effectively. Happy coding!
